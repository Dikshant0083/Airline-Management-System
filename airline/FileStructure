v# Airline Management System

 ## Project Overview
 This enhanced Airline Management System is a console-based Java application that implements data structures and algorithms with CRUD operations for managing flights, passengers, and bookings.

 ## Features
 1. **Flight Management**
    - Add, view, update, and delete flights
    - Search flights by source, destination, date
    - Sort flights by various criteria (price, time, etc.)

 2. **Passenger Management**
    - Register new passengers
    - View passenger details and booking history
    - Update passenger information
    - Remove passengers from system

 3. **Booking Management**
    - Create new bookings with seat selection
    - View booking details
    - Cancel bookings with proper refund calculation
    - Print professional-looking tickets

 4. **Data Structures Implementation**
    - Linked Lists: For maintaining collections of flights, passengers, and bookings
    - Binary Search Trees: For efficient flight searching by ID or route
    - Queues: For handling booking requests and waitlisting
    - Sorting Algorithms: For displaying flights by various criteria
    - Searching Algorithms: To find flights and passengers efficiently
